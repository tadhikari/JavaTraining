a.) student name, student id, course registered, gpa, standing (semester wise), residential status.
I think other than student name and gpa everything else can be exposed.

b.) Only one method is sufficient to calulate the grade of different type of student. Even though the declaration of the method
	might be same but the implementation will be different.

c.) setStudentId(int a)
	getStudentid()
	setStudentName(String name)
	getStudentName()
